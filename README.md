# Binary-Image-Classification

***Using Dall E and Stable diffusion*** Prompt to Identify Calm or Uncalm images.
All datasets from Dall-E2 and Stable diffusion prompt to identify Calm or UnCalm images <sub>based on author preference</sub>.

Results : 
- [x] SVM  - with accuracy score = 68.72
- [x] Convolutional Neural Network - with accuracy score = 80.53
- [x] Transfer Learning (Efficient Net) - with accuracy score around 75.
- [x] Transfer Learning ResNet - freeze-unfreeze - with accuracy score = 84.39
- [x] Vision Transformers - with accuracy score around 71.

1. > Transfer learning from Resnet with Freeze-Unfreeze got the best score 
2. > And SVM got the lowest score.
