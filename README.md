# Binary-Image-Classification

***Using Dall E and Stable diffusion*** image prompt to Identify Calm or Uncalm Images
All datasets from Dall-E2 and Stable diffusion prompt to identify Calm or UnCalm images <sub>due to own preference</sub>.

Results : 
1. SVM  - with accuracy score = 68.72
2. Convolutional Neural Network - with accuracy score = 80.53
3. Transfer Learning (Efficient Net) - with accuracy score = around 75.
4. Transfer Learning ResNet - freeze-unfreeze - with accuracy score = 84.39
5. Vision Transformers - with accuracy score around 71.

> Transfer learning Resnet using Freeze Unfreeze got best Results 
> And SVM got a least Results.
